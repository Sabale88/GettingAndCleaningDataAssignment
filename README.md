# GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment
This is my coursera final assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course

In this project there is only one script that gets the data from the web, filters only the relevant information and reshapes the data into one table. If you run the R file in this repo you will get the final desired Dataset. The code book contains all the information about the data manipulations I did and the names of the variables and features.
